## üí° Features

This project has some interesting features that I want to highlight:

#### Fetch data

- All the info related to the products (name, title, id, img url, etc) is taken from Firestore.
- This info is obtained through _fetch_ and _promises_ methods
- It was necessary to consult the documentation to find the suitable methods for CRUD operations: **getDocs**, **getDoc**, **addDoc**, **updateDoc**.
- For more information, follow this links:
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/get-data
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data

#### Post data

- This is an app that doesn't have a payment gateway; however, purchase orders are recorded.
- In a similar way, orders registered in the purchase confirmation form are sent to Firestore.
- In this way, the flow of information is bidirectional: from the cloud to the user and from the user to the cloud.

#### Private routes

- I decided to create a simple and minimalist backoffice to be able to see the orders received without needing to enter the Firestore platform.
- This is a **protected route** that **requires authentication**: access to the application will be requested using a username and password. If the username is found in the database, navigation to the private route will be allowed.
